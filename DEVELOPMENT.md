#### DESCRIPTION

The soil temperature and humidity probe, using the original temperature and humidity sensors as the core component, can be directly connected to the single chip microcomputer for use. With very high consistency, it can be completely interchangeable. The probe has the characteristics of temperature resistance, pressure resistance, loss of ability, suitability for agricultural greenhouse, flowers, nursery, lawn and other needs to detect soil temperature and humidity.
